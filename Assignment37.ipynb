    "\n",
    "Ordinal Encoding: Ordinal encoding assigns numerical values to the categories based on \n",
    "their order or hierarchy. The categories are assigned integer labels that reflect their \n",
    "relative positions in the order. For example, if we have a categorical variable \n",
    "representing education levels with categories \"High School,\" \"Bachelor's Degree,\" and\n",
    "\"Master's Degree,\" ordinal encoding may assign labels 0, 1, and 2, respectively. Ordinal\n",
    "encoding is suitable when there is a clear order or hierarchy among the categories.\n",
    "\n",
    "Label Encoding: Label encoding assigns each category in a categorical variable a unique \n",
    "integer label without considering any inherent order or hierarchy. The categories are \n",
    "encoded as integers ranging from 0 to (number of categories - 1). For example, if we\n",

    "order, which may be important for analysis or modeling purposes.\n",

    "# ans\n",
    "\"\"\" Target Guided Ordinal Encoding is a technique used to encode categorical variables \n",
    "based on their relationship with the target variable in a classification or regression \n",
    "problem. It assigns numerical values to the categories that reflect their correlation \n",
    "with the target variable's mean or median.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's how Target Guided Ordinal Encoding works:\n",
    "\n",
    "Group the data by each unique category in the categorical variable.\n",
    "Calculate the mean or median of the target variable for each category.\n",
    "Order the categories based on their mean or median values.\n",
    "Assign numerical values to the categories according to their order.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, let's consider a machine learning project to predict customer churn in a \n",
    "telecommunication company. The dataset contains a categorical feature called \"Contract\n",
    "Type\" with categories: \"Month-to-month,\" \"One year,\" and \"Two year.\" We want to encode\n",
    "this feature using Target Guided Ordinal Encoding.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's how you might use Target Guided Ordinal Encoding in this scenario:\n",
    "\n",
    "Group the data by each unique category of the \"Contract Type\" feature: \"Month-to-month,\" \n",
    "\"One year,\" and \"Two year.\"\n",
    "Calculate the mean or median of the target variable (e.g., customer churn rate) for each \n",
    "category.\n",
    "Order the categories based on their mean or median values. Let's assume the order is: \n",
    "\"Month-to-month\" < \"One year\" < \"Two year.\"\n",
    "Assign numerical values to the categories according to their order. In this example, you\n",
    "can assign values 0, 1, and 2 to the categories \"Month-to-month,\" \"One year,\" and \n",
    "\"Two year,\" respectively.\n",
    "The resulting encoded feature reflects the correlation between the \"Contract Type\" \n",

    "the target, potentially improving the model's predictive performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Target Guided Ordinal Encoding is particularly useful when there is a clear association \n",
    "between the categories of a variable and the target variable. It can provide valuable \n",
    "information to the model by encoding the ordinality of the categories based on their \n",
    "relationship with the target. However, it is important to ensure that the encoding is\n",

    "variables with high negative covariance suggest an opposite movement. This information\n",
